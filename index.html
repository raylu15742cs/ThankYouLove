    <h2>Dear Sandy Rong,</h3>
    <p> Hi Love. This has been a really really fun year. We have made so many new memories, tried so many new things, and we are just getting started. I cherish every moment that I get to spend with you and every moment that you are in my arms. I know that I am not the perfect boyfriend or husband, but I am always trying to be better. I love you so much. I am so happy when Apple suprises me with the reels of our adventures. Its like a lil treat during our busy lives of what a great thing we have. I am grateful for the shoes that you are getting me, and I will cherish and enjoy them. I hope you cherish and enjoy the presents that I got you too. :) I can not believe that we are about to reach 3 years Love (with no baby) hehe. I remember our good times and our bad times, but I think that I grow equally in both. In our good times, I feel like I can conquer the world. In our bad times, I learned what I need to do to make sure the same things never happen again. You are the greatest gift I have ever received. I will love you. Always.  </p>
